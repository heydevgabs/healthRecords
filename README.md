# **Healthcare CSV API üóÇÔ∏è**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a healthcare record management application that allows users to:
- **Upload a CSV file** containing healthcare records.
- **Search for a record** by its unique code.
- **List all records** in the database.
- **Delete all records** from the database.

The application is built using **Spring Boot** for the backend, **Angular** for the frontend, and uses **MySQL** as the database. A **Docker container** is provided for easy setup of the MySQL database.
